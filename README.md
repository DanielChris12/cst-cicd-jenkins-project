# Jenkins CICD Project

This project demonstrates how to set up Jenkins. Jenkins is a powerful automation server used for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines.

## Overview

Jenkins is a widely-utilized open-source automation server designed to automate diverse facets of software development, including building, testing, and deploying applications.

This repository hosts scripts and documentation crafted to facilitate the seamless upgrade of Jenkins to version 3.0 and beyond.

## Background

As Jenkins continues to evolve, it remains a widely-adopted automation server utilized by development teams to facilitate continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) workflows. Maintaining an up-to-date Jenkins server is essential to leverage the latest features, enhancements, and security patches. And this repository is dedicated to simplifying the upgrade process for Jenkins users seeking to transition to version 3.0 or later releases.

## Features

- **Simplified Upgrade Automation:** The repository houses scripts designed to automate the Jenkins upgrade process, eliminating the need for manual intervention. These scripts streamline the upgrade procedure for users, enhancing efficiency and reducing potential errors.

- **Comprehensive Guides:** Comprehensive documentation is available to assist users throughout the upgrade process. This documentation covers prerequisites, installation steps, and best practices, providing users with clear guidance to ensure a successful upgrade experience.

- **Compatibility Validation Processes:** The provided scripts incorporate compatibility checks to validate the compatibility of existing Jenkins configurations and plugins with the target version. By performing these checks, users can mitigate the risk of encountering compatibility issues during the upgrade process, ensuring a smooth transition.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding with the Jenkins upgrade facilitated by the scripts in this repository, it is essential to ensure that the following prerequisites are fulfilled:

- Jenkins instance is presently operating on version 2.x.
- A backup of Jenkins home directory and configuration has been created.
- Compatible versions of Java have been installed on the system.
- Internet access is available to download the latest Jenkins release and plugins.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cloudsolutionstech/cst-cicd-jenkins-project.git
   ```

2. Change to the repository directory:

   ```bash
   cd cst-cicd-jenkins-project
   ```

## Usage

Follow the instructions in this [Usage Guide](docs/UsageGuide.md) README to set up Jenkins using Docker and start automating your CI/CD workflows. Once Jenkins is set up, you can use it to create and manage CI/CD pipelines for your projects. Here are some common tasks:

Create a New Pipeline:
- Click on "New Item" on the Jenkins dashboard.
Enter a name for your pipeline and select "Pipeline", then click "OK".
Configure your pipeline using a Jenkinsfile or by specifying pipeline script directly.

Trigger a Build:
- Whenever you push changes to your repository, Jenkins can automatically trigger a build based on your configured webhook or polling interval.

View Build Results:
- Jenkins provides detailed build logs and reports, allowing you to analyze the outcome of each build.
